* "Oh, it's kanban boards"  Yes, but actually a list of lists for a grp of ppl.
* Joel surveyed Xl users, none of them were doing "calcs" but using xl to create lists.
* Lotus Improv was supp 2 make Xl obsolete, but bombed coz good @ calcs but terrible @ creating tables; everyone was using Xl to create tables.
* New category: there's been no great list-of-lists app b4 Trello
* Biz strategy: to get to 100m users
* Free (biggest impedent to growth is price)
* @ That pt were using Mongo/WebSockets/CoffeeScript/Node

* Trello has draggable cards + swimlanes but can't query/filter on that data.  (Another user: Trello does have a custom flds feat, see <a href='https://trello.com/guide/enterprise/advanced-features'>this</a> )

I like Trello A LOT have like 30 different boards with probably thousands of cards.
Why Trello over Sheets?

I use Trello as basically a really extensible digital kanban board.

It also makes easier to associate tasks with each other add extra context (for instance if I'm keeping track of some long form context associated with a task where would you put that in sheets? A note? Can you search those? Once it gets really long a Google doc? I guess).

Also can add custom fields. I used this to allow me to add weights to cards so they automatically rearrange in priority order.

I even have boards that serve as a personal knowledge base.

I feel like Trello gives you really great free reign to discover a process for things and have it evolve over time.

Could you accomplish that with sheets? Probably but not as elegantly and definitely not with a UI

You are right that a spreadsheet gets more information on the screen, but Trello's kanban layout really highlights which task is "where" (in what state).
I've often used it with clients to let them know which high-level features are in progress, which are done, etc. It has also worked really well for collaborative trip planning. Both of these workflows benefit from cards with cover images too.

It's not a replacement for a company-wide knowledge base or an issue tracker for hundreds of tickets.

All the stuff you mentioned is not important when you’re collaborating on a project with others. Addition? Version control? Lol. Whatever.
Just because you don’t understand why people use Trello does not mean everyone’s a frivolous idiot.

What do you guys do for a living? Not a joke question.

GitHub more or less offers this in the Projects board feature:
