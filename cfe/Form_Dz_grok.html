Hi there!  

Please output your answer(s) in HTML format (not markdown).

Today I need your help with preparing a competitive evaluation of Form Design features in four different NoCode dbms systems, viz: AirTable/MSLists/Google Forms/Notion.  (I work for a company building a competing product).  
There are also non-DBMS apps which _only_ do Form Design; viz.: Typeform/JotForm/Formly.  In a way these *do* compete against the four above, as well as my app; so I would like you to also consider them in any answer/research I request.

I wish to take a deep dive into specifically Form Design features in these four products.  Please list the strongest & weakest features for each product; as well the result on their respective competitive edges.

Please also consider the other prods I mentioned (Typeform etc.) and let me know if I should adopt any specific features from them in my noco app.

Here is an overview of my app so far (specific to Form Design):
- My app (the Dev client is winForms/dotNet for Win/Linux/Mac) has standard Drag-drop functionality to choose/drop/rearrange fields on the form.
- It also offers the standard input-validation features most apps do; plus the ability to create/drop 'Formula Fields' which may connect to another table (LookupFld) or be a calculated value (e.g. SubTotal*TaxRate)
- My app is developer-centric; it allows embedding the Table/Grid/Form(s) _within_ the client's own website (ie not hosted @ https://google/clientName)
- Since it allows this functionality; it also allows the corresp. flexibility: for instance, GoogleForms allows a standard 16 backgroundColors for your form; my app allows infinite (to match the rest of the dev's website).  Same with fonts/etc.
- My app allows coloring/formatting any 'fieldPanel' via fonts/foreColor/backColor.  Besides actual table fields, FieldPanels may also include help txt, instructions, etc.
- My app allows Design-level-Undo (e.g. you drop a field on the form, change colors: you can step back and undo/redo)
- My app offers Design-level-Versioning (you can see which dev made which changes when, and rollback if you wish)
- My app allows devs to embed tables (for example, to create an Order List).  I plan to offer a summary/totals row autocalculated.
- My app allows devs to resize a 'FieldPanel' (via rows/columns) and it will auto-layout the whole form on every change.  All this functionality is in the desktop client; the dev can hit the 'Preview' button anytime to preview the Form in the Edge browser.

Lastly, please provide links to images/walkthroughs/documentation of any specific features you spotlight in this area.  Thx in advance.

        <h2>Suggestions for Adopting Features from Typeform, Jotform, and Formly</h2>
        <p>These dedicated form builders emphasize engagement and advanced interactions, complementing your developer-centric app's strengths (e.g., embedding, infinite customization, undo/versioning, auto-layout, formula fields, table embedding). Here's what to consider adopting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>From Typeform:</strong> Implement <em>conversational forms</em> (one question per screen) to boost completion rates by 3.5x through engaging, mobile-friendly flows. This aligns with your preview-in-browser but adds interactivity without sacrificing embeddability. <img src="https://www.privyr.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-24-at-11.30.18-1024x571.png" alt="Typeform Conversational Form Example" style="width:400px;"> <a href="https://www.typeform.com/platform-overview" target="_blank">Typeform Platform Overview</a></li>
            <li><strong>From Jotform:</strong> Add <em>advanced widgets and templates</em> (1,000+ pre-built) for quick starts, plus robust conditional logic and payment integrations (e.g., multiple methods). Enhance your drag-drop with their no-code widgets for multimedia (e.g., Loom videos) to rival their ease for non-devs. <img src="https://cdn.jotfor.ms/assets/img/landing/features/_list/drag-and-drop.png" alt="Jotform Drag-and-Drop Builder" style="width:400px;"> <a href="https://www.jotform.com/features/" target="_blank">Jotform Features</a></li>
            <li><strong>From Formly:</strong> Incorporate <em>multilingual support and results visualization</em> (e.g., charts, personality quizzes) for global/analytical use cases. Their dynamic Stripe payments based on responses could extend your formula fields for e-commerce embeds. <img src="https://www.apriorit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/screenshot-2-web-form-with-a-custom-field-type-for-uploading-files.png" alt="Formly Advanced Form Example" style="width:400px;"> <a href="https://www.getformly.com/features" target="_blank">Formly Features</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, prioritize conversational modes and widgets to differentiate from DBMS tools while leveraging your embedding/versioning for dev appeal. This could position your app as a hybrid powerhouse.</p>
