Please output your answer(s) in HTML format (not markdown).
(1) I am currently evaluating the prospect of building a No-Code Database building app to compete against MS Lists.  Here are the major competitors in the space: 
- AirTable
- Ms Lists (and PowerApps)
- Google Sheets (and Google Apps/Forms)
- BaseRow (OSS)
- NoCoDb (OSS)
- Coda
- ReTool
Let's go in for a Deep Dive on Forms.  Besides the 7 apps listed above; there are also some Forms-only apps (e.g. typeform, Formly, JotForm).  Please include their evalutions also.
(2) For these form-only companies (I have the data for the 7 main NoCo apps), please create an html table columns for | Name | Available Since (date) | Number of users | Annual Sales | Cost (e.g. $20/mo)|
(3) I want a Form Feature Evaluation covering all the above apps.  First, for an app developer, please list _Essential Features a Form Designer Shd Have_ ranked by importance
(4) Next, pls list the top features requested across all apps; and the top 5 for each app (incl notes if another app has the feature)
(5) Finally, please give me a detailed evauation of the Drag-And-Drop functionality offered by the majore NoCo Form Designers.  I know that for instance, Coda shows all Table fields to the right of their Form Designer and allows users to drag and drop *from* the dialog panel *to* the Form; but does the app allow reqpositioning (ie drag-drop to reposition?)  Which app has the best UX for Drag-Drop?  What would the best offering be for all possible users (novice/pro)?
(6) At the end of the article pls provide links to documentation and/or help articles describing Form Designers; as well as links in context to images of any features you are discussing.
Thx in advance.

    <h2>5. Drag-and-Drop Functionality Evaluation</h2>
    <p><strong>Key Questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does the app allow repositioning of fields via drag-and-drop?</li>
        <li>Which app has the best UX for drag-and-drop?</li>
        <li>What would the ideal drag-and-drop UX be for both novice and professional users?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Drag-and-Drop Features in Major Apps:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Coda:</strong> Coda allows users to drag and drop fields directly from a dialog panel to the form. It does allow repositioning of the fields, which is excellent for flexible form creation. However, some users report that the interface can be a bit crowded with multiple fields visible at once.</li>
        <li><strong>AirTable:</strong> AirTable’s drag-and-drop functionality is smooth. Fields can be easily moved around in the form layout but are limited to column-based structures, making it more suitable for users familiar with table-based views.</li>
        <li><strong>MS Lists:</strong> Users can create forms using PowerApps, but drag-and-drop is not as fluid compared to other apps. It does allow repositioning, but the workflow is not as intuitive as dedicated form apps.</li>
        <li><strong>JotForm:</strong> Known for its excellent drag-and-drop builder, JotForm allows full repositioning of fields within a form. The drag-and-drop experience is smooth, and users can easily reorganize elements in any part of the form. Additionally, the interface is well-designed with clear visual cues, making it suitable for both novice and pro users. It also offers an intuitive user flow, which reduces the learning curve for new users.</li>
        <li><strong>Typeform:</strong> Typeform’s drag-and-drop system is not as robust as others, primarily because it focuses on multi-step and conversational forms. However, it does allow users to drag and reorder questions within a section. The user interface is very clean and minimalist, and while it's user-friendly, it’s a bit restrictive when dealing with larger, complex forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Formly:</strong> Formly has a simple drag-and-drop interface that allows users to reposition form fields easily. The UI is clean, but the tool is more tailored for straightforward forms and might lack some advanced drag-and-drop flexibility seen in apps like JotForm or Coda.</li>
        <li><strong>BaseRow (OSS):</strong> BaseRow allows repositioning of fields using a drag-and-drop interface, but it can be a little cumbersome. The functionality is there, but some users report that the UI doesn’t feel as fluid or intuitive as those of more mature platforms like AirTable or JotForm.</li>
        <li><strong>NoCoDb (OSS):</strong> As an open-source tool, NoCoDb allows for drag-and-drop interactions, but the user experience is somewhat raw compared to proprietary tools. Customization options are vast, but they come with a steeper learning curve. Repositioning of fields is possible but not as seamless as more polished competitors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Best UX for Drag-and-Drop:</h3>
    <p><strong>JotForm</strong> leads the pack for the best UX in drag-and-drop form building. It strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality, offering users a smooth experience when moving fields around. The ability to reorder fields and manage large forms with ease makes it particularly favorable for both novice users and professionals.</p>
    <p><strong>Coda</strong> offers an excellent user interface, especially with its drag-and-drop support for tables, but its experience can feel cluttered when too many fields are visible at once. Coda's drag-and-drop functionality allows a high degree of customization, making it ideal for power users who need flexibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Typeform</strong>, while not as flexible, is still user-friendly and focuses more on conversational form creation. Its drag-and-drop feature is ideal for more basic forms but may not meet the needs of users looking to design complex layouts.</p>

    <h3>Ideal Drag-and-Drop UX for Novices and Pros:</h3>
    <p>The ideal drag-and-drop UX should cater to both novices and professional users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For Novices:</strong> A clean, minimalist interface with clear visual cues, tooltips, and easily accessible features is key. Users should be able to drag fields into the form without much effort, with minimal distractions or complex customization options. A guided tutorial or onboarding flow is a plus to help users get up to speed.</li>
        <li><strong>For Professionals:</strong> Advanced users require more flexibility, including the ability to move fields, reorder sections, apply conditional logic, and create multi-step workflows. These features should be accessible without overwhelming the user interface, with options to customize the look and feel of forms further. Flexibility should not come at the expense of usability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The No-Code form building space has evolved significantly over the years, with numerous competitors offering different strengths and weaknesses. Whether you're looking for a form-only tool like JotForm or Typeform, or a more integrated platform like AirTable or Coda, each app has its own unique features that appeal to various user needs.</p>
    <p>For anyone looking to build sophisticated forms with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, JotForm stands out as the most user-friendly option for both beginners and advanced users. However, if you're a professional looking for highly customizable options, tools like Coda or AirTable might provide more flexibility.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the tool you choose, it's clear that no-code form designers are powerful and accessible to all, from novice users to developers seeking advanced customization. The future of this space looks promising, with more innovations and integrations likely to emerge in the coming years.</p>
