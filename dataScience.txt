Mike is a Senior Data Scientist with extensive industry experience since 1991, mostly as a Lead/Principal level programmer.  

Mike has Built, Tested and Trained Machine Learning Models from scratch.
A 2018 Text-Classification and Tokenization project requirement needed the latest ML features, 
namely the then recent Google Research usage of *nGrams*.  
The toolkit being used (Java-based ML Toolkit Mallet, govt. sponsored) had not been updated for a while.
Mike built, tested and deployed an independent module using Dependency Injection to add the features to the Machine Learning 
Toolkit without touching a single line of their code (licensing requirements)
Mike has considerable experience with the Java-based ML/NLP engines, including Mallet, Weka and the Stanford NLP Toolkit.
Mike has hands-on experience training models and understands tokenizing, stemming/lemmas, and model optimization techiniques.
If required Mike could build you a ChatGPT clone from scratch.

The variety and extent of Mike's industry experience has ensured that he has always been current with the highest business standards and a wide wealth of technology stacks.  Mike has worked with some of the top IT teams in the country and has benefited from the exposure.

In Depth
Besides working at contract positions, Mike owns his own business - an IBM Business Partner - since 1994.  He has built and sold software in the US and Europe.  Since about the past six years Mike has been CTO of a NoSQL SaaS startup. 
Mike is comfortable working with Management: he has worked at a Senior Level for more than a decade and has a wealth of Domain knowledge across the spectrum.
The wealth of Mike's experience has exposed him to in-depth hands-on knowledge and experience which clients have always valued: Mike has extended the JDK and built custom libraries/assemblies/modules in JavaScript, F# and more; as well as pushed or pulled data from data warehouses and sources as diverse as SAS/SPSS/JD Edwards/DB2/Oracle and more.
Mike has much experience using fairly esoteric technology in the workplace.
Mike is a Functional Programming enthusiast.  If you give him the option of using F#/DotNet over Apache Pig, he will tell you about how he can build and run massively parallel, concurrent programs without locks/latches/race-conditions using the Async Monad and F#'s Computation Expressions.  However, he can work on any system, using most languages.
Mike is a US citizen and has a US Government Security Clearance.
