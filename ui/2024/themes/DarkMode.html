<br><b>8 tips article</b>
<br>1. Avoid pure black
<br>Material design recommends #121212 as dark theme surface color. (ie bkgrnd) reduce eye strain
<br>
<br>2. Avoid using saturated colors on dark themes
<br>Use lighter tones (colors in the 200–50 range) because they have better readability on dark theme surfaces.
<br>
<br>3. Meet accessibility color contrast standards
<br>Ensure that your content remains comfortably legible in Dark Mode
<br>Google Material Design recommends using a contrast level of at least 15.8:1 between text and the background.
<br>Use color contrast <a href='https://uxpro.cc/toolbox/accessibility/color-accessibility/'>tools</a> to test contrast ratio.
<br>
<br>4. Use “On” colors for text
<br>typically used for text.  pure white wd 'vibrate'.
<br>Google Material design recommends using a slightly darker white:
<ul><li>
High-emphasis text should have an opacity of 87%
</li><li>Medium emphasis text is applied at 60%
</li><li>Disabled text uses an opacity of 38%.
</li></ul>
<br>
Also, Light text on a dark background can appear more bold than dark on light. That’s why you may want to use lighter font weights for dark mode.
<br>
<br>6. Communicate depth
<br>In light mode, we use shadows to express elevation:  the higher surface gets, the wider a shadow it casts.
<br>In dark themes built with Material, elevated surfaces and components are colored using overlays. The higher a surface’s elevation, the lighter that surface becomes.

<br>Step 1 — Split in half
<br>Split the entire colour palette in half and ensure each half has an equal quantity of tints/shades. Creating a light and dark theme then becomes a matter of swapping the equivalent colour from the opposite half of the colour palette.

<br>
<br>Step 2 —Include enough colours
<br>Include enough shades and tints for the various button types and states.
<br>
<br>Step 3 — Make accessibility easier
<br>Swapping equivalent colours from each half of the colour palette has the advantage of giving both themes the same amount of contrast. Therefore if the light theme passes accessibility contrast standards — the dark theme will automatically pass.
<br>
<br>Hybrid themes, a theme containing both light and dark areas, can also make use of this system. (eg Toolbar/SideBar dark, clientArea reg	)
