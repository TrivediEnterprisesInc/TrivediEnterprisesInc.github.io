Here in Norway, a "consultant" is just someone who is employed by a different company but works for your company. We don't get people to listen to the right people.<br>
We just work like everyone else while the company pays a premium for us and we're the first to be let go if things go downhill.

In the US, that's a contractor. Many contractors are called "consultants," but it's mostly because "consultant" sounds better.<br>
Consultants are (in abstract) paid much more for their expertise, and engagements are much more limited. A contractor might work 40 hour work weeks for one client for years.<br>

My experience is that the take-home pay is almost identical for all three. To give an example, at one point in my career, I could:<br>

* Charge $600-$900/hour as a consultant<br>

* Charge $125-350/hour as a contractor<br>

* Charge $150k-$200k as an employee<br>

On paper, that works out to >$1M, 0.25-0.75M, and 0.15-0.2M, respectively, if I worked 40 hour work-weeks. In practice, at least for me, net pay was very similar for all three:<br>

* Consulting had many hours overhead for one hour of work, and clients would often cancel on short notice.<br>

* Contracting had an even split between selling myself and working. Work came in spurts (either too much, or not enough)<br>

* Employment was steady<br>

Free markets converged to very similar net take-home pay. Contracting and consulting had much more diversity of work (contracts, marketing, etc.), more flexibility on side projects (startups, etc.), and much more volatility. Volatility can be good or bad. A dry-spell can mean time to finally go on that vacation or focus on that startup. Or it can mean a lost mortgage. It depends on your life stage, savings, etc.<br>

As a recent grad, contracting worked well for me. As a Dad, I preferred employment. Late stage (no kids at home, and mortgage paid off), consulting seems like the way to go.<br>

>They (Consultants) are great for taking the blame for decisions you had planned on making.<br>
One might say that's the point of consultants! They're there to externalise accountability, you're outsourcing taking the heat.<br>

>In short: The people you’re talking to aren’t the people who are doing the actual work, The people who are doing the work have no industry experience And the numbers they’re basing their analysis on are probably whatever they found on google.<br>
this has always been the most mindboggling thing about consultants. I have a few friends working as consultants and occasionally when they discuss cases, I always think to myself, "who on earth are you to advise them about so-and-so management when you literally just graduated college a year or two ago?"<br>

The value is that (ideally) they've asked around and figured out how half a dozen peer firms do what you're struggling with. So while they may not have solved your management problem personally, they can give you an idea of what's worked for your peers without all the icky industrial espionage and antitrust violations you'd need to find it out yourself.<br>

They call it “best practices”.<br>
Where did they learn what’s changed in best practices for fast food logistics since the last time they consulted for Burger King? Well, funny enough, they were recently engaged by McDonalds…<br>

This. You can have an open acknowledgement that the consultant knows jack as long as they can give you the sourcing of their underlying insights and best practices and it passes the sniff test.<br>

A friend of mine who worked as a very high level consultant for years once said that consultants are often wrong, but never in doubt. Having just graduated doesn't really change that dynamic, as long as you have the confidence to pull it off.<br>

The idea is they reduce problems to conceptuals. You don’t need experience, and in fact industry or specific experience is often a hindrance, to solving conceptual problems.<br>
They do this many times a year (see: young people working crazy hours). <br>Pattern recognition develops. They now lead 20-somethings doing this <br>work.

The idea that age == competence is a bad one IMO.<br>

I've been on both sides - as a management consultant at a top firm and within a corporation hiring a top consulting firm.<br>
The grunt consultants are the ones making the slides, but they aren't deciding the direction of the project or the output. Every project I worked on as a consultant had a lot of input from the person who sold the work (their reputation is on the line!). But let's be honest, most consulting projects aren't mind blowing - basic stuff like "what is the competition doing", "what is the the flavor of the month for fund raising".<br>

And in terms of "not having experience in the area", that's fine in a lot of cases. Often consultants are brought in to do work the company doesn't have the resources to do. Or, if it's a new area you need advice on, you partner with the consulting firm on how to do that. Maybe it's interviewing experts in the field, maybe it's creating case studies of how other companies did it.<br>

I did work with one consulting firm that had domain knowledge (small boutique firm). The consultants had industry experience and a ton of contacts. We basically boiled down what answered we needed and they tracked down the answers.<br>

While on both side I've never been a part of the a project where what consultants offered wasn't 100% clear to the client. HN acts like consultants are pulling the wool over clients eyes but that's never been my experience. They new exactly what they were paying for.<br>


	
conductr 6 months ago<br>

In my experience, this is all disclosed (partner/manager/associate). Pretty much any proposal I've seen from the top firms includes a cost estimate built by using hours x rate for each respective job title and often further broken down by stage of the project. Time and material bids are most common so you should be asking for this up-front, I actually view it as a bit of a red flag if they don't voluntarily disclose/bid it this way (eg. if I'm paying for time, I need to know how much time is being planned for and by which rate level).<br>

	
smokefoot 6 months ago<br>

The more expensive the services, the less likely you are to get a bid in this format.<br>

	
conductr 6 months ago<br>

Very true. I regularly get it on $500k-$2m projects, that's probably considered small. Of course it's caveated to hell with talk of "projection", "risk", etc. But that's part of my job is asking questions so I can anticipate whether they can execute on this or if it's perhaps some ambitious low bidding techniques.<br>
FWIW, I also don't work in tech. Finance/accounting/management consultants are my world. I could definitely see how software/tech is more ambiguous by it's very nature.
<br>

bob778 6 months ago<br>

That’s the difference between management consulting and technical/expert consulting. Expert consulting is for spinning up CRMs or installing SAP, management consulting is far more vague and <b>strategy level</b>.<br>
Some of the big firms have started mixing the terms up because they can charge more that way.

The same holds for marketing and advertising, which makes sense if you consider an agency to be a consultancy.<br>
The pattern I've seen repeated everywhere: A genuinely knowledgeable expert sells their expertise via online content, books, and seminars. This attracts the clients. The expert will attend a few key client meetings. But then, unbeknownst to the client, they disappear and leave the work to juniors.<br>

This is so ubiquitous that, earlier this year, I decided to change my career aspirations. I'd long wanted to be an agency leader, but the pattern above was repeated at every successful agency I came across, and it's not something I can stomach any longer.<br>

So, I decided to put myself out there as the expert. I write a newsletter. I published a book. I'm pursuing speaking engagements. Just like the other consultants do.<br>

However, I don't pass my clients onto anyone else. They're hiring me. They were sold on my expertise, so my expertise is what they're going to get.<br>

When a project grows too big for one person to handle, or when there are aspects of the work that don't justify my high hourly rate, I transparently inform my clients of my intention of bringing on freelancers for those aspects. It's all done out in the open.<br>

And while I do charge a markup on the work my subcontractors do on my behalf, it works out to far less than my hourly rate, and my clients are fully aware of the markup being charged and what value I'm providing in return (i.e.: supervision).<br>

All of which is to say: I think consultants can provide incredible value. (I know, I know... a consultant who believes on consulting. Shocking!) But you do have to be careful, and oddly enough, the bigger and more reputable the consulting firm, the less I would trust them. The business rewards bad players.

Small consultants, like me, are a world apart from what is otherwise an accurate depiction of big consulting. My firm and many of my friendly competitors, work on specific questions or projects - do it cheaply, quickly and within scope.<br>
Sometimes you need the resources size brings to the project, but absent mergers, migrations and enterprise software launches - small consulting is probably the better choice.<br>

Also, the same can be said of big law and big accounting - albeit on the legal side senior partners often bring more value.

So after years of being an engineer there is a part of me that is entranced by the idea of being a quick talking, sharp suited business consultant. Anyone whose been one of those "management consultants" have any advice for moving from tech to get picked up by one of the big firms?<br>
EDIT: As for the why, I've been working as an engineer at large organizations so long I figure it might be nice to be on the other side of the consulting table and be considered an "expert" instead of the obnoxious "human resource" constantly whining about obnoxious reality. It get's tiring, and it seems nice to be one of the slick suited bad guys.

Look into “solution engineer”, sometimes called “sales engineer” or “pre-sales engineer”. They are often paired with a sales expert as their technical partner. There are often 1 solution engineer to 2-4 sales experts.<br>
Solution engineers are often engineer / developers who are good at communicating, explaining, asking questions. Activities often involve “technical proof-of-concepts” (commonly called POCs), running trials and “bake offs” (for example comparing between competitors). SEs often work closely with product engineering - communicating customer requirements, figuring out how to integrate with a clients’s particular setup, hosting workshops & webinars, going to a clients HQ and whiteboarding solutions. Often 25% travel (1-2 days on site with local customers, and travel once a month by flight to spend time with a customer for workshop.) You are expected to keep your tech skills sharp. Some progressions of this role are called “Field CTO”. This person is often a domain + technology expert (eg eCommerce + cloud microservices).<br>

One financial benefit of a SE role is that - being on the sales org of the company, you are on the revenue generating side - not a cost center. Quality of life in the company can be nice because of that. Your compensation will often have a variable “bonus” to it - tied to the performance of the sales team (eg 25%+ of your total compensation).<br>

If you know a piece of software, tool, or general domain, and you’re personally a big fan of them and use their software, that might be a good company to talk to about SE positions. Sometimes they might have a “developer advocate” role - which is someone who is also very plugged into the company’s customer / developers community.<br>

If you’re interested in getting an SE job, one easy “cheat code” would be recording yourself doing “how to” on that company’s software, post to a youtube, and sharing it where customers are - might even be a subreddit you’re already in.<br>

I saw a video where someone scanned thru months of a niche subreddit, found most common problems, and then made videos on how to solve those. Another idea is to use a tool like AnswerThePublic.com to find top questions related to a topic you know well (its based on search trends) - pick questions that are easy for you to answer, be prepared to see how crappy and annoying most videos are to solve that… then make your own video. Don’t want to get much into video on this thread, but Google Slides + OBS / simple 5 min how-to screenshare with decent audio would be better than 95% of the videos out there.<br>

I’ve done this for awhile and happy to answer questions/ help out - worked at large cloud SaaS companies, and my clients are large well-known “Fortune 500” companies.<br>

My career has bounced around from developer / architect / project manager / professional services (consultant) / customer success (technical account manager) / engineering product manager/ entrepreneur/ solution engineer and “fractional CTO” for startups.

Neither Accenture nor McKinsey are Big 4. The Big 4 are PwC, EY, KPMG, and Deloitte. Despite what the name suggests they aren’t actually the top consulting firms (the name comes mostly from their accounting work.The three consulting firms, at least in terms of cost/prestige, are McKinsey, BCG, and Bain (MBB for short).<br>

  <br>
  The entire article + comments have missed the best thing about LN: the speed to build applications.
  <br>It was 6-10x faster than anything I've used before or since.  This is not an exaggeration.
  <br>Products like Notion (or other 'low code' products) can probably do this today (I only know one person who uses Notion) but it continues to amaze me how many people in business today are completely unaware of the value of being able to create good applications quickly.

On Mao's Contradictions (New Left <a href='https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii66/articles/tariq-ali-on-mao-s-contradictions'>Rev</a>)
<br>
Must read after reading any bio of Mao/related<br>
Excerpts:
<br>
The intellectual ferment that had gripped the country since 1911 
had shown few signs of abating; disputes between different 
philosophical currents dominated cultural life in the cities. 
Cai Hesen, a close friend of Mao’s, had ended up in <mark>Paris</mark> from 
where he wrote lengthy letters describing the <mark>impact of the 
Russian Revolution on Europe</mark> and underlining the links between 
<mark>theory and practice</mark>—accounts which helped to radicalize Mao.
<br>
(In 1925)...Moscow poured in money and established military links <mark>with the 
Nationalists</mark>—a course that was to prove disastrously mistaken 
when the gmd turned against their Communist allies in 1927.
<br>
Whether the 1925–27 Chinese revolution would have succeeded 
without Comintern interference remains an intriguing 
counterfactual. Had it done so, the country would 
have been united against Japanese imperialism,
which would have made the occupation difficult, if not 
impossible, to sustain. This would have had far-reaching 
consequences, and not only for the Far East.
<br>
The Shanghai massacres of 1927, instigated by the gmd’s 
new paramount leader Chiang Kai-shek, led to the virtual 
liquidation of local Communists and allied trade unions 
in the city.
<br>
After 1941, the Nationalist armies began to haemorrhage 
soldiers and officers to the advancing Communist armies 
and partisans, under the joint political-military command 
of Mao Zedong, Zhu De and Peng Dehuai. The strategy Mao 
had laid out in such texts as <mark>‘On Guerrilla Warfare’</mark> (1937) 
and <mark>‘On Protracted War’</mark> (1938) was reaping rewards.  (see also 'The Little Red Book')
<br>
In Washington, Truman and, later, the Dulles brothers 
thoughtlessly assumed that Mao’s victory had strengthened 
the Communist monolith, and that henceforth China would be 
little more than Stalin’s satrapy. But before the 
realization of their error dawned, they attempted a costly 
and risky containment. With un cover, General MacArthur 
moved to prevent the Korean Communists from taking power 
over the whole peninsula, which had been liberated from 
Japanese colonial rule in 1945. The Communists were driven 
to the North, and thousands of civilians were massacred in 
the process. When full-scale war began in 1950, Chinese 
leaders went to aid the besieged North Koreans. Their help was decisive.

<div class="caption" style="display:none;">
Advice FOR:
<br>If endpoints are stateless and independent, being able to scale them all separately and only payinbg for use (where usage is << 100%) it can be a huge win.
<br>
Much concern abt debugging capabs for serverless (non-existant to difficult).  Advice:<br>
You shd design it such that everything is in one monorepo & the entire sys can alw be run on one dev's local laptop without ANY serverless/cloud stuff..and in a single proc if possible.
<br>Then have a flag/config to allow certain things to communicate over the net instd of as fn calls, and using svrless fns.
<br>Some concern abt Cold Start Times, many devs use fake ping to keep always alive (in case no traffic 24 hrs)
<br>
"Svrless is good for any app if you accept its pricing.  Perfect scalability, perfect availability."  A proper alternative for svrless is Kubernetes, which'll cost less for a big app but require more knowledge to lproperly manage.
<br>"Instd of saying its good for bursty/low traffic I'd say for any wrkload that isn't close to fixed."  Went from 1st usr tp 100ks with no adjustments at all.  Even with millions of usrs, little change.  Scaling probs become billing probs.
