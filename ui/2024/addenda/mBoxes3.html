<br>A decent (dated) thread w/some good comments on Hourly Billing, consensus is hourly is only for starting out, then companies expect a number for var. reasons

 EFCore comes to mongo
<div class="caption" style="display:none;">

Recent, Q4 2023 ->
<br>The MongoDB provider for EF Core is in its first preview
<br>
<a href='https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/efcore-mongodb/'>Dotnet</a>
<br>...If we look at the JSON... we can see it contains nested documents for all the contact information.
<br>(C# classes; drivers create nested json arrays)...
allows using .net native methods like SaveChanges or SaveChangesAsync + LINQ
<br>
<a href='https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-provider-entity-framework-core-now-available-public-preview'>Mongo</a>
<br>* nearly 33% of all devs use c#
<br>* 41% of c# devs use EF-core
<br>
<br>* The only unusual benifits this offers:
<br>- Change tracking: The Provider allows you to track and save changes made to entities with each DbContext instance back to your MongoDB database.
<br>- Class mapping and serialization: Your classes in C# will map to MongoDB in a predictable way, including when working with IDs as well as date and/or time values.

 LN RAD
<div class="caption" style="display:none;">
  Comments from The Register's LN article include this:
  <br>
  The entire article + comments have missed the best thing about LN: the speed to build applications.
  <br>It was 6-10x faster than anything I've used before or since.  This is not an exaggeration.
  <br>Products like Notion (or other 'low code' products) can probably do this today (I only know one person who uses Notion) but it continues to amaze me how many people in business today are completely unaware of the value of being able to create good applications quickly.

Possibly the best concise political history of Pakistan.
<hr>
On Mao's Contradictions (New Left <a href='https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii66/articles/tariq-ali-on-mao-s-contradictions'>Rev</a>)
<br>
Must read after reading any bio of Mao/related<br>
Excerpts:
<br>
The intellectual ferment that had gripped the country since 1911 
had shown few signs of abating; disputes between different 
philosophical currents dominated cultural life in the cities. 
Cai Hesen, a close friend of Mao’s, had ended up in <mark>Paris</mark> from 
where he wrote lengthy letters describing the <mark>impact of the 
Russian Revolution on Europe</mark> and underlining the links between 
<mark>theory and practice</mark>—accounts which helped to radicalize Mao.
<br>
(In 1925)...Moscow poured in money and established military links <mark>with the 
Nationalists</mark>—a course that was to prove disastrously mistaken 
when the gmd turned against their Communist allies in 1927.
<br>
Whether the 1925–27 Chinese revolution would have succeeded 
without Comintern interference remains an intriguing 
counterfactual. Had it done so, the country would 
have been united against Japanese imperialism,
which would have made the occupation difficult, if not 
impossible, to sustain. This would have had far-reaching 
consequences, and not only for the Far East.
<br>
The Shanghai massacres of 1927, instigated by the gmd’s 
new paramount leader Chiang Kai-shek, led to the virtual 
liquidation of local Communists and allied trade unions 
in the city.
<br>
After 1941, the Nationalist armies began to haemorrhage 
soldiers and officers to the advancing Communist armies 
and partisans, under the joint political-military command 
of Mao Zedong, Zhu De and Peng Dehuai. The strategy Mao 
had laid out in such texts as <mark>‘On Guerrilla Warfare’</mark> (1937) 
and <mark>‘On Protracted War’</mark> (1938) was reaping rewards.  (see also 'The Little Red Book')
<br>
In Washington, Truman and, later, the Dulles brothers 
thoughtlessly assumed that Mao’s victory had strengthened 
the Communist monolith, and that henceforth China would be 
little more than Stalin’s satrapy. But before the 
realization of their error dawned, they attempted a costly 
and risky containment. With un cover, General MacArthur 
moved to prevent the Korean Communists from taking power 
over the whole peninsula, which had been liberated from 
Japanese colonial rule in 1945. The Communists were driven 
to the North, and thousands of civilians were massacred in 
the process. When full-scale war began in 1950, Chinese 
leaders went to aid the besieged North Koreans. Their help was decisive.

  <br>in 2014 sold to xing.com (the German LinkedIn) for a high 7 digit figure.
  <br>A German job portal asked him if they cld access the CV data; he said "You'll need to buy the site then" - was asked a price - quoted Euro 400k, doubled it hours l8r ('after carefully calculating again').
  <br>He was still interested, so our man contacted his biggest German competit.s...xing offered him a lower upfront pymt but a huge earnout upside.

<div class="mBox dev serverless architecture" >
 HN Serverless thread(s)
<div class="caption" style="display:none;">
Advice FOR:
<br>If endpoints are stateless and independent, being able to scale them all separately and only payinbg for use (where usage is << 100%) it can be a huge win.
<br>
Much concern abt debugging capabs for serverless (non-existant to difficult).  Advice:<br>
You shd design it such that everything is in one monorepo & the entire sys can alw be run on one dev's local laptop without ANY serverless/cloud stuff..and in a single proc if possible.
<br>Then have a flag/config to allow certain things to communicate over the net instd of as fn calls, and using svrless fns.
<br>Some concern abt Cold Start Times, many devs use fake ping to keep always alive (in case no traffic 24 hrs)
<br>
"Svrless is good for any app if you accept its pricing.  Perfect scalability, perfect availability."  A proper alternative for svrless is Kubernetes, which'll cost less for a big app but require more knowledge to lproperly manage.
<br>"Instd of saying its good for bursty/low traffic I'd say for any wrkload that isn't close to fixed."  Went from 1st usr tp 100ks with no adjustments at all.  Even with millions of usrs, little change.  Scaling probs become billing probs.
<br> Full Serveless means minimum state + event-driven + functional.

Svrless rsch <br>
Architect <a href='https://architectelevator.com/blog'>Elevator</a> blog<br>
High Scalability ('what the inet says' posts freq highlight svrless pro/con)
<hr>
CONS<br>
Lambda ok for one-shot tasks OR taking from a queue but NOT for API endpoints.
<br>With continuously running apps (100 concurr usrs) svrless costs much more than running a continuous VM.
<br>'If you have an api getting sustained traffic Lambda prob.ly not yr best bet'
<br>'What's it gd 4? queue proc - Event proc - intl infra code'
Most svrless offerings cap the exec time to <mark>15 minutes</mark>.
