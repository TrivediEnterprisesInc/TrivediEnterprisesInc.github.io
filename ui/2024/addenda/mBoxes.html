             Ask HN: What do you use for API Key Management?
              <div class="caption" style="display:none;">
Q: 	
Many developer portals allow you to generate API Keys. Is there a SaaS service that is powering these or is all of that logic being built in-house?
<br>... 
I'm not so much talking about the type of token issued (JWT/Opaque), but more about the service that manages issuing and revoking keys. (i.e. something similar to what Stripe has on their developer portal.<br>Was hoping Auth0 had a solution for this but Auth0 but doesn't <a href='https://community.auth0.com/t/how-to-implement-api-keys-using-auth0/6296/10'>look</a> like they do
<br>
A: Typically an API gateway is behind a lot of these. Lookup KrakenD, Gloo Mesh as examples.  Also Kong
<p>
Q: 	
I need to implement API-key generation and management for a multi-tenant SaaS.  I already use Keycloak for user+password logins<br>
A: If you are using Keycloak, the solution might be in this <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52230634/issuing-api-keys-using-keycloak'>SO</a> post

API keys aren't as secure as authentication tokens, but they identify the application or project that's calling an API.<br>
While API keys identify the calling project, they don't identify the calling user. For instance, if you have created an application that is calling an API, an API key can identify the application that is making the call, but not the identity of the person who is using the application.<br>
API keys are generally not considered secure<br>
When to use API keys:
<ul><li>
  You do want to block anonymous traffic.
</li><li>
  You want to control the number of calls made to your API.
</li><li>
  You want to identify usage patterns in your API's traffic.
</li><li>
  You want to filter logs by API key.
</li></ul>
API keys cannot be used for:<br>
- Identifying individual users
- Secure authorization

<h3><a href='https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/api-key/'>API Key</a> Authentication</h3>
App Services supports the following two types of API keys:
<br>
<b>Server API keys</b>: API keys associated with server users that is created from the App Services CLI, API or UI.
<br>
You can provide a server key to external applications and services to allow them to authenticate directly with App Services.
<br>
You can associate up to 100 server API keys with an app.<br>
<b>User API keys</b>: API keys created from the Realm SDKs associated with application users.
Each user API Key is associated with a single non-anonymous user. <br>Each user can associate up to 20 user API keys with their account.
<p>
  <h3>Email/Password Authentication</h3>
Note: App Services can automatically send a confirmation email<br>
Email/password authentication allows users to create an identity in your application based on a username and a password.<br>
To enable Email/password authentication, your application should support a method of email confirmation, and a method of resetting a user's password<br>
There are multiple implementation options for each of these requirements.

             HN: On MRR as a metric
              <div class="caption" style="display:none;">
Q: Can someone educate me on why MRR is the primary metric? MRR doesn't tell you if the startup is profitable, which is presumably the goal - to make money. If your costs are $3M/month, an MRR of $100K sounds like a terrible deal. Wouldn't it make more sense to report profits?<br>
A: revenue is hard to manipulate, while profits are very easy. Buy and furnish a new office and then your cost suddenly hits $3m that month.
<br>
Anyone who takes any kind of venture capital is expected to have negative profits. They can hire contractors, outsource social media marketing to agencies, outsource hiring contractors to agencies, and so on. Uber used to buy cars and then sell them to their drivers, to get more drivers. Grab gave out free phones so taxi drivers could download the app.
<br>
Startups aren't about profits, they're about growing an asset as fast as possible and then selling it off to someone who can utilize same asset for higher value. e.g. YouTube and WhatsApp don't bring in money themselves, but work very well into Google and Meta strategically.
<br>
It's also common to seed "marketing cost" into unsustainable coupons/discounts and such. That's unhealtht revenue, but it's also why unit economics (the cost of one unit sale) is another metric. Turns out it's bloody difficult to fix unit economics. But this is why people check that unit economics are positive and then read MRR.<br>
A2: As long as you believe you can acquire customers for some margin less than (you project) they will pay you across their lifetime as a customer, the rational choice to to maximise your money is to spend all the money you have (and more!) on acquiring more customers.<br>
As a result, the majority of SaaS businesses aren't profitable, and people talk mostly about MRR.<br>
A3: Because revenue is hard to fake, while a lot of the other metrics are easy. For example, a manager could cut costs via layoffs, get their bonus because the profitability increases in the short term and then they would leave to the next company. The old company may die as it has lost talent, knowledge and motivation in the long run. Doing these kind of tricks with revenue is much harder to pull off.<hr><br>
Startups spend like $2-$5 per $1 of MRR, which is why they run out of runway and constantly need more investors.<br>
Successful startups spend more like $1.25 per $1 of MRR.<br>
Profit is for solo founders and bootstrapers.<br><hr>
<b>5x ARR</b> is normally for what SAAS software cos get acquired.<br>

             Goog Keep vs Evernote?
              <div class="caption" style="display:none;">
Google <a href='https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/google-keep-vs-evernote-which-one-is-best/'>Keep</a> or Evernote?
<br>
<br>Google Keep:
<br>Users can create four different types of notes: text, image, drawing, and lists.  You can also add reminders to notes, color code them, and create custom tags.
<br>To find notes, use 
Grid View and a List View. Users can also sort between regular notes and reminders. For sorting features beyond this, users need to employ custom tags. 
<br>
Extensions & Ease of Use
<br>One of the many strengths of services like Google Keep and Evernote is how easy it is for users to save websites, images, and video clips from the web. If you come across something relevant to your research, you don’t need to copy the link and create a new note. Just click the extension or add-on icon to automatically create a note.
<br>Google Keep automatically creates a note when you activate the extension, but it does give you the option to title the note and include details about what the note entails. 

<br>The Evernote Web Clipper functions in much the same way, but it gives users more options when saving content. <a href='https://www.online-tech-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Evernote-Snip.png'>img</a><br>

             Alan Rufus (Hastings): Richest of all time
              <div class="caption" style="display:none;">
From Tim Noah's NewRepublic bkRev of <u>As Gods Among Men</u> by Guido Alfani
<br>
Princeton University Press, 440 pp., $35.00<br>

In late September 1066, William of Normandy asked his second cousin, Alan Rufus (<i>en français</i>: Alain le Roux), to join the Normans’ fateful war party against the Saxons. Rufus was the second son of a Breton count, at a time when the firstborn son would inherit the title and all the family wealth. It was unlikely that he would prosper if he remained in France. So he enlisted in William’s expedition to England, distinguishing himself as a commander at the Battle of Hastings. After William’s victory, he had himself crowned king, confiscated lands from the Saxon nobility, and doled out their vast estates to his favorites. Rufus received a great deal of property in Cambridgeshire. After he then helped William suppress various Saxon rebellions, he was given a lordship and even more land in Yorkshire (where Rufus’s castle <a href='https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/richmond-castle/history-and-stories/history/'>still stands</a>).
<br>
Before Rufus died in 1093, the economic historian Guido Alfani informs us in As Gods Among Men: A History of the Rich in the West, the combined revenues from his landholdings reached, by one estimate, more than 7 percent of England’s entire national income. That would make Rufus just about the richest person ever to live in England (excluding kings and queens), Alfani writes. One calculation puts Rufus’s wealth, in 2023 dollars, at $242 billion. By comparison, the cosmetics tycoon Bernard Arnault, who topped Forbes’s 2023 list of the richest people in the world, has a combined family wealth of $211 billion.<br>
Rufus was born into wealth and benefited from a family connection, but he earned most of his fortune through his own labors—that is, by <mark>shedding</mark> copious quantities of Saxon blood. With the advent of Norman feudalism, this path to wealth largely gave way to the <mark>quality</mark> of one’s own blood—that is, to being born into nobility.<br>
...
<br>
In Marx’s time, ... wage growth, which had been virtually nonexistent through the second half of the eighteenth century, accelerated dramatically starting around 1820, and had risen somewhere between <b>30 and 50</b> percent by the time Marx published the first volume of Das Kapital 47 years later. Even though capital’s share of the pie expanded, the pie itself grew so fast that workers prospered.<br>

Observing this phenomenon with amusement, in 1858 Friedrich Engels wrote that England was acquiring <b>“a bourgeois proletariat alongside the bourgeoisie.”</b> The working class was living better than it had in most people’s living memory. Engels and, later, Vladimir Lenin attributed this to <b>colonial plunder</b>. Engels’s collaborator Marx judged both cause and effect immaterial. Excessive interest in matters of economic distribution, he wrote, was <b>“vulgar socialism,”</b>

                Comment #1<br>
"Some founders are tempted to simply increase the purchase price of their common stock, to get the desired amount of capital into the corporation when they pay for their shares. Most startup lawyers recommend against this approach because it can affect the FMV of the common stock. The value of equity compensation for employees and consultants is tied to the difference between the common stock FMV at the time of issuance, and the price at which the equity is eventually sold. Therefore, startups typically try to avoid prematurely causing an increase in the common stock FMV, to maximize the value of the equity compensation."
<br>
“Instead, founders typically contribute cash to the corporation in the form of a simple loan. With a simple loan, the company would be obligated to repay the founder at a later time, along with nominal interest.”

Comment#2<br>
Q: Would it be "piercing the corporate veil" to accept payments before incorporating, then moving everything to separate accounts afterwards?<br>
A: No you simply convert the sole proprietorship to an LLC (or corporation). You <mark>"sell" your intellectual property</mark> to the newly created corporation in exchange for your founder stock. A sole proprietorship is sort of like the default business structure, you don't really need to do anything to start it, everything just ends up on your personal tax return.

              <div class="caption" style="display:none;">
From Spolski's article: <b>The Process of Designing a Product</b>
<p>
Refers to 'Activity Based Planning' idea of Mike Conte/Excel Team<br>
The key insight is to figure out the activity that the user is doing, and focus on making it easy to accomplish.<br>
(instd of) blank canvas w/menu items; offer a list of activities the usr might do, eg. top three (for a card design site): <br>
* Make a birthday card <br>* Party Invitation <br>* Anniversary Greeting
<br>
Now you're thinking like the user; and they'll find it easier to get started w/o browsing the menus etc.<br>
You already have a list of activities your usr needs; decide which ones you want to focus on.<br>
Later you may wish to add-on features for ea activity; e.g., for Birthdays/Anniv.s set up a recurring reminder.<br>
The other great thing abt Activity Based Planning is that it lets you make a list of features NOT to do: evaluate which of the (long) feature list support the most imp. user activities.<br>
<hr>
From another article titled 'Simplicity':
<br>
80% of the people use 20% of the features.<br>
So if you only impl 20% of the features you can still sell 80% as many copies.
<br>
Making simple, 20% prods is an exc bootstrapping strategy coz you need limited resources & min. audience.<br>
You're using your weakness as a strength (Judo strategy)
<br>
Works for bootstrapping, however, this won't work as a long-term strategy<br>
Nothing they've done @ Fog Creek increased rev more than releasing a ver w/new features<br>
Most new featuress result in a permanent rev increase.<br>
"Simple" as in easy to use is fine, but can't go far if you leave features out.

Jim Highsmith devised a way to come up w/ a vision stmt, which he calls <b>Design the Box</b>:<br>

Assume the prod is sold in a shrink-wrapped box.  Design the box, front & back.<br>
Come up w/a name, graphic, 3 or 4 key bullet points on the front to 'sell' the prod<br>
Plus a detailed desc on the back and operating requirements<br>
Follows the form:
<ul><li>For (tgt cust)
</li><li>Who (nd/opportunity)
</li><li>The (prod) is a (prod categ)
</li><li>That (key benefit, compelling reason2buy)
</li><li>Unlike (primary competitn)
</li><li>Our product (stmt of differentiation)

              <div class="caption" style="display:none;">
From Spolski's article: <b>Set Your Priorities</b>
<br>
If you ever find yourself implementing a feature promised to <mark>one</mark> customer, red lights shd be going off in your head.  You're drifting towards consultingware.
<br>
Shrinkwrap is a take-it-or-leave-it model of software development.
<br>
Shrinkwrap has no marginal costs for ea additional customer.  You're essentially selling the same thing over and over again.
<br>
The kind of features big, rich customers want are not the ones the mass market wants.
<br>
Also, don't do things because they're inevitable.  (ie, "you'll eventually have to do it anyway") If they're not <b>essential</b>, you don't have to do them.
<br>
At any given point what is the most important thing to get done <b>right now</b>?
<br>
For feature priorities, consider each impl.'s cost, then poss popularity/cust feedback
<br>
This approach was used @ the Excel team, roughly 50% of the features they didn't have time to do were 'really stupid' and the <mark>prod was better coz they didn't get done</mark>.

<br>
I'm so tired of seeing so many products with the same features <b>that nobody wants</b>. It's bad enough to let feature requests from users get out of control, but when we start adding features just because our <b>competitors</b> have them, we're all screwed.
<br>
New features are <b>easier to promote</b> than better/working versions of existing ones. Or so we think...
<br>
Perhaps if we devote all of our attention to users (and our own ability to innovate), we'll stop being dragged off into areas that build our feature list, but often at the expense of users.
<br>
...the more features we add, the more danger there is of the dreaded featuritis:
<img src='https://web.archive.org/web/20060809075850im_/http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/featuritis_2.jpg'>
<br>
If our only "competitive advantage" is by staying one step ahead of The Feature Arms Race, we're vulnerable.
<br>
I think in many cases, the more you <b>try</b> to compete, the less competitve you actually <b>are</b>.

...Stop Writing Dead Programs (video) by Jack <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ab3ArE8W3s'>Rusher</a> captures a lot of where my head is at here.
<br>
Emacs is the only program where I truly feel that I can naturally modify it....
<br>
The amount of friction to this sort of modifiability is crucial to the amount of value it can add. In Interface ergonomics I argue for lowering friction because it often changes what things people are willing to do.
<br>
Self-modifiability is the exception, not the rule in modern applications.
<br>
By building tightly integrated, unlimited, and convenient modifiability into your applications, you give your users the chance to solve their own problems.
<br>
you can provide <b>a huge amount of value</b> to users by empowering them to modify your application.
<br>
We should leverage the fact that tailoring a software application to your individual needs is easier than any other product in history. As an industry, we need to admit that one size does not fit all.

from "Work on stuff that <a href='https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/wtf-whats-the/9780062565723/text/9780062565723_Chapter_16.xhtml'>matters</a>" Tim O'Reilly (the publisher) Jan 2009
<br>
When Clayton Christensen introduced the term <b>disruptive tech</b> in his 1997 business classic, <u>The Innovator’s Dilemma</u>, he wanted to know why existing companies <b>fail to take advantage</b> of new opportunities. He discovered that breakthrough technologies that are not yet mature first succeed by <b>finding radically new markets</b>, and only later disrupt existing markets.
<br>
The point of a disruptive technology is not the market or the competitors that it destroys. It is the new markets and the new possibilities that it creates.
<br>
This was true of Microsoft, of Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and it is also true of current disruptors like Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb or the researchers who are taking us pell-mell into a future of self-driving cars and other applications of artificial intelligence. They started out trying to solve a problem.
<br>
I urge you to forget disruption and instead work on stuff that matters.
<br>
<ol><li>

Whatever you do, think about what you <b>really value</b>
  <ul><li>
great companies have <b>“big hairy audacious goals.”</b><br>
“Solve the biggest problem you can.”
</li><li>
Pursue something so important that even if you fail, the world is better off for you having tried.
</li></ul>
</li><li>
  Create more value than you capture
  <br>
  ...create a self-reinforcing value loop with and for others. 
  <br>
Focusing on solving big problems rather than on making money, and focusing on creating more value than you capture, are closely related principles. The first one is a test that applies to those starting something new; the second is the harder test that you must pass in order to create something enduring.
</li><li>
  Take the long view, focus on the big picture
  <br>
</li><li>
  Aspire to be better tommorrow than you are today
  <br>
  If we are to lead the world into a better future, we must first dream of it.
  <br>
  Scenario planning: develop “robust strategies” that work in the face of radically different futures
