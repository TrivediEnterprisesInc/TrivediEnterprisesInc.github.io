<p><strong>System</strong> 100% F#.</p>
<ul>
<li>Immutable database wrapper around MongoDB.</li>
<li>Static type guarantees.</li>
<li>No null values.</li>

<h2 id="the-details">The Details</h2>
<h3 id="describe-brij">Describe <code>Brij</code></h3>
<p>Conceptually, a Database System only has four basic commands: <code>Create</code>, <code>Read</code>, <code>Update</code>, and <code>Delete</code>.  A regular SpreadSheet program has many more.  Any regular SpreadSheet user - say, a Project Manager or a Startup Founder - should be able to Create a Database Table, associated Forms and DataViews, and operate it without the help of a Development Team.</p>
<p>An application that can allow such a user to perform these tasks without coding would increase business productivity to a staggering extent.  Every Project Manager would build and run hundreds of queries on demand.  All business users would become <em>de-facto</em> coders.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Technically savvy readers are already probably thinking &quot;You mean NoSQL?  But every Database Developer has been trying to build such a system since 50 years!&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>Agreed.  And yes, we have built it.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Technically savvy readers are now probably thinking &quot;But there are at least a hundred other No-code or Low-code Database Systems in the world today, including Microsoft's PowerApps.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>None</strong> of the No-Code Systems are <strong>Extensible</strong> enough for a real Enterprise-use case.</p>
<p>And <strong>None</strong> of the Low-Code Systems are <strong>Easy</strong> enough for a Spreadsheet user to use.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-you-see-the-database-market-in-2033">How do you see the Database market in 2033?</h3>
<p>This is a Google Trends Report.  I would expect this to substantially change if not overturn a decade from now.</p>

<h2 id="the-tech-stack">The Tech Stack</h2>
<h3 id="brij-internals"><code>Brij</code> Internals</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>Brij</code> System is currently <code>100% F#</code> with a <code>MongoDB</code> backend</p>
</li>
<li><p>The product currently has NO <a href="prodStack.html#zero-dependencies-on-outside-code" title="Dependencies">external dependencies</a>, except for the following 'internal' libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/" title="FParsec"><code>FParsec</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/FsLexYacc/" title="FsLexYacc"><code>FsLex/FsYacc</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these libraries are used internally by dotNet to compile <code>F#</code> itself.<br>
Both libraries are also used to compile <code>Q#</code> (Microsoft's <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/tree/main" title="QSharp"><em>Quantum Development Kit</em></a>).<br>
Mike is familiar enough with both of these libraries that he can write a compiler for a custom toy language from scratch.<br>
In case of any potential copyright issues it would not be unreasonably difficult for Mike or any competent F# developer to roll an adequate handmade version of each of the above.  <em>It would be somewhat time consuming, however.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-dependencies-on-outside-code">ZERO Dependencies on Outside Code</h3>
<p>As such the <code>F#</code> ecosystem has a fairly robust set of external open source libraries which provide missing but expected functionality.
One example is <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpPlus" title="FSharpPlus">FSharpPlus</a>.  This library offers a set of tools including</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens" title="lenses">Lenses</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/State_Monad" title="StateM">State Monad</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style" title="CPS">Continuation</a> Monad.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are three tools which were needed in <code>Brij</code>, so we hand-rolled custom versions of each - porting the State monad from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml" title="OCaml"><code>OCaml</code></a> and the Continuation monad from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell" title="Haskell"><code>Haskell</code></a>.  Lens are commonly used in functional programming circles to work with immutable data; but we found them too cumbersome to use and built a workaround using <code>F#</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming" title="Metaprogramming">meta-programming</a> facilities coupled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)" title="Reflection">Reflection</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fsharps-metaprogramming-features">FSharp's MetaProgramming Features</h3>
<p>F# has numerous strengths in this area; in fact it is derived from a family of languages that were specifically designed for metaprogramming, the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)" title="ML">MetaLanguages</a> (ML) family.  You will find some details below, these and other F# features are extensively used by <code>Brij</code>.</p>
<h3 id="code-quotations">Code Quotations</h3>
<p>FSharp's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/code-quotations" title="CQs">Code Quotations</a> are close to what you would get with <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/124930/how-useful-are-lisp-macros" title="macros">macros</a> in a language like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" title="Lisp">LISP</a>.  They allow you to generate expressions programmatically which you can then execute.  By using the ReflectedDefinition attribute on F# expressions you can get access to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" title="AST">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>s.<br>
Extensive further information on F#'s MetaProgramming features can be found <a href="https://fsharp.org/teaching/research.html#dsls-and-meta-programming" title="meta">here</a>, especially <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1159876.1159884" title="paper">this</a> research paper by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dsyme/" title="DSyme">Don Syme</a>, a Principal Researcher at Microsoft and one of the primary designers of the <code>F#</code> language.<br>
The libraries referred to above (<code>FParsec</code> &amp; <code>FsLex/FsYacc</code>) also allow compilation on-the-fly.</p>
<h3 id="a-monadic-linq-query">A Monadic LINQ Query</h3>
<p>The following code snippet builds a monadic F# query.  If you are at all familiar with SQL this should resonate.  But how would you build this <strong>programatically</strong>?</p>
<pre><code>query {
            for p in products do   
            sortBy p.Category   
            thenBy p.ProjectName   
            thenBy p.SubModName   
            groupBy (p.Category) into g   
            let c1Ct = query { for grp in g do count }   
            let c2 =    
	    ...
	    ...
            select (g.Key, c1Ct, c2)
            }
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-output">The output</h3>
<p>If the above query is run on a MongoDB instance of <code>product</code>s, it produces the following (raw) output -&gt;</p>

<h3 id="manipulating-the-ast">Manipulating the AST</h3>
<p><code>Brij</code> manipulates the AST and compiles it dynamically to generate a new Query on the fly.  For further information on this capability, please see <a href="https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-compiler-docs/fcs/typedtree.html" title="typedtree">this</a> F# man page.</p>
<h3 id="f-repl">F# REPL</h3>
<p>One final MetaPrograming facility <code>Brij</code> uses is the F# <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="repl">REPL</a> (Read-Eval-Print Loop).  REPLs facilitate exploratory programming and debugging because the programmer can inspect the printed result before deciding what expression to provide for the next read.<br>
Here is an example of what you can do with a REPL:<br>
Remember the HumVee-like Mars <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_rover" title="rover">Rover</a>?  NASA scientists were controlling it with a <code>LISP</code> program.  Something went wrong when the vehicle was on the surface of Mars, and the lead programmer used a REPL to reprogram the vehicle remotely.<br>
For the curious, a marvelous account of this incident can be found on <a href="https://www.corecursive.com/lisp-in-space-with-ron-garret/" title="replPodcast">this</a> podcast from Adam Gordon Bell.</p>
