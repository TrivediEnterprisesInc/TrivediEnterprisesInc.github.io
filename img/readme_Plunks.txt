_Aug16_ created 2024gridStyle1 plunk to work on grid styling/UI

_Jul23_ started afresh [too much non-wasm stuff and now we're working on that]; yest'day's plnk contains all the webComp stuff + hugh.jpg and much more 'Addenda Jul22a Cumul8ive' NOTE that the mBoxAddendas nd 2 be patched 2 main

_Jun01_ size limit coz of embedding Cal scripts; so removed all gfxAddenda files

_May20_ this plunk refused to save the latest Cal work (out of space) so **ALL the d3 stuff was removed**, chk the last plunk @ g91uoR6DcAOPFyiC for the d3 stuff

_May03_ plunk [HoShU8brOeagysIp] apparently reached a size limit; therefore this one.
